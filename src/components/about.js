        <b>Software Testing</b>: I have over 2 years of experience working as a software tester. In this role, I automated GUI tests and analyzed the results of more than 1100 automated nightly tests.

        <b>Data Project</b>: I took on a freelance data project where I developed Python scripts to extract API stock data and load it into a MySQL database. Additionally, I set up storage and hosting using AWS, ensuring efficient data management and access.
